This is code from a group project in the third year. Most, but not all was written by me. In particular I carried out 
the EDA - all comments in that file are mine - and produced all of the visualisations.

The purpose of the project was to identify significant predictors from a high-dimensional data set via LASSO,
stepwise regression etc and fit a multiple regression model.

I wasn't particularly happy with the final output from this project - the time pressure was very high, it was late in term two when
the team were generally tired and busy with other work, and I felt we spent a lot of our limited time spinning our wheels before
finally making progress very late in the day.
